# Highlight menu item on scroll

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/joxmar/pen/NqqMEg](https://codepen.io/joxmar/pen/NqqMEg).

I wanted to test a way to be able to scroll to different sections on the page, and also to be able to highlight in the menu the corresponding item to section being viewed.
